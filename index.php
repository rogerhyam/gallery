                I photograph the forces that shape the Scottish Landscape.
                These include us &mdash; not just those of us in historical memory but our
                land ancestors stretching back to the retreat of the ice sheets some ten thousand years ago.
                I hope to show the land as us rather than something other, that we merely have a relationship to.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy creating film negatives as tangible artifacts.
                From these negatives I make both modern, pigment and traditional, darkroom prints.
                The logistical challenges of using a large format camera force me to engage with the world
                in a way I might otherwise avoid.
                Working only in black and white helps me concentrate on form and meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I seek to create a personal response to a place rather than a pleasing facsimile.
                Every moment contains beauty if we look deeply enough but few can yield photographs
                that convey how it touches us.
            </p>
            <p>
                My physical and emotional state inter-are with the materials I use, the scenes I photograph and the
                viewers of finished works.
                I therefore try to follow the Buddhist principles of Right Speech.
                My photographs should be timely, true, affectionate, helpful and come from an open heart.
                Often I am not in the right place physically, emotionally or spiritually and so leave my camera behind
                and simply enjoy looking.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope my work provokes a deeper examination of who we are through the landscapes we create.

            <p>
                In gratitude, I bow to this land and all the ancestors who made it available.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see that I am whole, protected and nourished by this land and all of the
                living beings who have been here and made life easy and possible for me
                through all their efforts.
            <p>
                I see the hard-working farmers and fishermen,
                miners, labourers and shipbuilders, and I see the women – the crofters
                who held the hearths, the fisher quines who followed the boats, the
                women waulkers who wove the cloth and the culture of the people into
                song, the wise women and healers.
            </p>
            <p>I see the close family bonds of the
                clans, and the traveller folk, the 'summer walkers' who lived close to the
                earth and followed the rhythms of the seasons.
            </p>
            <p> I see Maire Mhor nan
                Oran (Big Mary of the songs), Robert Burns, George Mackay Brown, and
                all the poets, artists and musicians who have contributed to the rich
                heritage of this country. I see James Keir Hardie, Ramsay MacDonald
                and John Smith - champions of social justice; I see Alexander Fleming
                and Joseph Lister, whose discoveries of penicillin and antiseptics
                continue to save so many lives; I see Andrew Carnegie, who used his
                great wealth to promote learning, literacy and peace; and Queen
                Margaret, who ruled with such compassion that she was made a saint.
            </p>
            <p>
                I
                see the conservationist John Muir, considered to be the father of the
                environmental movement. I feel the power of the sacred places in this
                land – the standing stones of our earliest ancestors; Holy Island, now a
                centre for world peace; Iona, home to early Celtic Christianity; Findhorn,
                beacon of light.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel the energy of this land penetrating my body and
                soul, supporting and accepting me. I vow to cultivate and maintain this
                energy and transmit it to future generations. I vow to contribute my part
                in transforming the violence, hatred, and delusion that also still lie deep
                in the collective consciousness of this society so that future generations
                will have more safety, joy and peace.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ask this land for its protection and
                support.

                Earth Touchings</a>
            used in Scotland by the <a href="https://plumvillage.org/">Plumb Village</a> Zen tradition.

            Earth Touching is the spiritual practice of contemplating what has been transmitted to us by
            our ancestors. The text was written by Lindsay Lumsden, Margo Henderson and Hugh Green
